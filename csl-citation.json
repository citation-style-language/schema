CSL in-line citation standard
-----------------------------

This is a proposed open standard for embedding CSL citations in a document.

It is currently implemented and will be released in the next major release of Mendeley after 0.9.9.

It's the same structure as a citeproc "minimal citation data object" http://gsl-nagoya-u.net/http/pub/citeproc-doc.html#citation-data-object, except with:

* a "schema" element with a URL pointing to this document
* an added "itemData" element containing the full item data as returned by sys.retrieveItem() and the same as one array item of https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-data.json
* an extra "uris" array which can contain any number of unique identifiers.
* an optional "mendeley" object containing:
    * "previouslyFormattedCitation" - the previous text of the formatted citation, we can use this to determine if the user manually altered the formatted text
	* "manualFormatting" - if this field is present, it represents a user's custom formatting which overrides the CSL processor formatting
	
The implementation of this can vary depending on the Word processor used. Currently Mendeley uses the following:
* WinWord: In-line citations and bibliographies are represented by a field code of type wdFieldQuote
           or temporarily represented as a bookmark if exporting to OpenOffice
* OpenOffice: In-line citations are of type com.sun.star.text.ReferenceMark, bibliographies are of type com.sun.star.text.TextSection
           or temporarily represented as a bookmark if exporting to Word

If you are trying to implement this and want help ensuring compatibility or have suggestions for changes, please get in touch with me at steve.ridout@mendeley.com, or better yet on the xbiblio mailing list: https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/xbiblio-devel

* Example in-line citation field code contents from Mendeley (with newlines for readability):

(The "Mendeley Citation{970e7ce0-8a21-482e-b7d6-e77794a2d37d}" bit is optional, any text before "CSL_CITATION" can be ignored)

"Mendeley Citation{970e7ce0-8a21-482e-b7d6-e77794a2d37d} CSL_CITATION
{
	"schema": "https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json",
	"citationID":"12rsus7rlj",
	"citationItems":
	[
		{
			"id":"ITEM-1",
			"itemData":
			{
				"id" : "ITEM-1",
